## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Data Flow Architecture:
```
User Interaction → Page Component → ProductService → Supabase → Real Data → UI Update
```

### Cart Integration Pattern:
```javascript
const handleAddToCart = (productId) => {
  const product = products.find(p => p.id === productId);
  if (product) {
    addToCart(productId, 1, { 
      dealerId: product.dealer?.id,
      price: product.price 
    });
  }
};
```

### Backend Integration Pattern:
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const response = await ProductService.getProducts({
      sortBy: 'newest',
      limit: 50,
      inStock: true
    });
    
    if (response.success) {
      setProducts(enhanceProductData(response.products));
    } else {
      setError(response.error);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed to load data');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```
